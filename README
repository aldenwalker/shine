shine

Copyright 2014 Alden Walker

shine currently does the following:
(1) finds and visualizes hyperbolic structures on surfaces
(2) visualizes embedded surfaces in R^3

shine is currently in development.  The goal is that shine should be 
able to nicely display hyperbolic geodesics on surfaces embedded in R^3.
